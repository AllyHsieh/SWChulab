## Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)

The PCC is used to assess the linear relationship between two variables. It is denoted by the symbol r and ranges from 1 to 1, which provides valuable insights into the degree of association between two sets of data.

The formula to calculate the PCC (r) between two variables of X and Y with n data points,

$$r=\frac{\Sigma^n_i=1(X_i-\bar{X})(Y_i-\bar{XY})} {\sqrt{(X-\bar{X})^2} \sqrt{(Y-\bar{Y})^2)}}$$
