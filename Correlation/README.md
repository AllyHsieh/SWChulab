## Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)

The PCC is used to assess the linear relationship between two variables. It is denoted by the symbol r and ranges from 1 to 1, which provides valuable insights into the degree of association between two sets of data.

The formula to calculate the PCC (r) between two variables of X and Y with n data points,

$$r=\frac{\Sigma^n_i(X_i-\bar{X})(Y_i-\bar{XY})} {\sqrt{\Sigma^n_i(X-\bar{X})^2} \sqrt{\Sigma^n_i(Y-\bar{Y})^2)}}$$

$$\bar{X}$$ and $$\bar{Y}$$ are the average of variables respectively.

As r = 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable increases proportionally. As r = 1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases proportionally. As r = 0 indicates no linear relationship b etween the variables.
