# Reconstruction of high-speed scanning volumetric images

Following is the steps of reconstruction:

1. Sorting 3D image from 2D tiff

2. Calibration of the edges result from galvo accelration

3. Time correction for voxel dependent

4. Reslice in z direction into layer/micrometer unit

Before starting, please check the parameters for calibration of y-axis
